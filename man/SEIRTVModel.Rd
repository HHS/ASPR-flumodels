\arguments{
\item{population}{Size of population; defaults to 1}

\item{populationFractions}{Vector of population fractions (all non-negative, 
sum to 1); defaults to 1, representing a single population group}

\item{contactMatrix}{A matrix whose (row i, column j) entry denotes the 
number of potentially infectious contacts a single individual from group j 
has with individuals from group i each day; defaults to proportional mixing}

\item{R0}{Average number of secondary cases from a single infected individual
in a completely susceptible population; must be specified}

\item{latentPeriod}{Latent period in days; must be specified}

\item{infectiousPeriod}{Infectious period in days; must be specified}

\item{seedInfections}{Fraction of the population to seed with infections; 
single fraction or vector of fractions by population group; defaults to 0}

\item{priorImmunity}{Fraction of the population with prior immunity; single 
fraction, or vector of fractions by population group; defaults to 0}

\item{useCommunityMitigation}{Whether or not to use community mitigation
implemented by modulation of the contact matrix; defaults to FALSE}

\item{communityMitigationStartDay}{If using community mitigation, day of the
simulation on which to start mitigation; must be specified if applicable}

\item{communityMitigationDuration}{If using community mitigation, duration of
time during which mitigation is in effect; must be specified if applicable}

\item{communityMitigationMultiplier}{If using community mitigation, the
non-negative matrix of multipliers that will be used to modulate the contact
matrix by elementwise multiplication; must be specified if applicable}

\item{fractionSymptomatic}{Fraction of the infections that are symptomatic 
cases; single fraction or vector of fractions by population group;  defaults
to 0.5}

\item{fractionSeekCare}{Fraction of the symptomatic cases that seek medical
care; single fraction or vector of fractions by population group; defaults
to 0.6}

\item{fractionDiagnosedAndPrescribedOutpatient}{Fraction of the outpatient
medical care seeking cases that are diagnosed and prescribed antiviral
drugs; single fraction or vector of fractions by population group; defaults
to 0.7}

\item{fractionAdhere}{Fraction of the cases that are prescribed antiviral
drugs that adhere to the regimen; single fraction or vector of fractions by
population group; defaults to 0.8}

\item{fractionAdmitted}{Fraction of the cases that require hospitalization
that are admitted; single fraction or vector of fractions by population
group; defaults to 1}

\item{fractionDiagnosedAndPrescribedInpatient}{Fraction of the hospitalized
cases that are diagnosed and prescribed antiviral drugs; single fraction or
vector of fractions by population group; defaults to 1}

\item{AVEi}{Antiviral efficacy: prevention of transmission from infected 
individuals taking antiviral drugs; defaults to 0}

\item{AVEp}{Antiviral efficacy: probability that antiviral treatment averts 
hospitalization and/or death; defaults to 0}

\item{vaccineAdministrationRatePerDay}{Vaccine administration rate each day; 
defaults to 0}

\item{vaccineAvailabilityByDay}{Vector that contains the amount of vaccine 
available each day; defaults to 0}

\item{vaccineUptakeMultiplier}{Vector of multipliers that determines the
relative rate at which vaccine is given to each age group; defaults to
vaccine being allotted proportionally by population}

\item{VEs}{Vaccine efficacy: protection for vaccinated susceptible 
individuals; single fraction or vector of fractions by population group;
defaults to 0}

\item{VEi}{Vaccine efficacy: prevention of transmission from vaccinated 
infected individuals; single fraction or vector of fractions by population
group; defaults to 0}

\item{VEp}{Vaccine efficacy: prevention of symptomatic illness in
infected indivduals; single fraction or vector of fractions by population
group; defaults to 0}

\item{vaccineEfficacyDelay}{Delay in days between administration of dose and 
onset of protection; defaults to 7}

\item{simulationLength}{Number of days to simulate after seeding infections; 
defaults to 240}

\item{seedStartDay}{Day on which to seed initial infections; defaults to 0}
